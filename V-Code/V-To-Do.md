# What V Wants to Focus on 

## Radiation 

1. Compare radiation measurements over time from both static and mobile sensors to identify areas where elevated radiation is detected. How does this change over time? How should the risk of radiation damage be mitigated?

2. Try to determine when Earthquake happened based on radiation levels 

## Wrangling Tasks 

1. Split date and time into 2 separate columns

2. Average 9 values for each 5 minute interval -> (one value instead of 9 values) to reduce number of observations
